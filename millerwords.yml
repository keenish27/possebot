ferret:
  - You know he is one!
  - What is the difference between Miller and a ferret? There is none!
keilbasa:
  - Miller sure loves eating that keilbasa
  - The more keilbasa the better says milla!
  - Did someone say kielbasa? That reminds me of the time Belcher put his PP on Miller's lips. Gross!
